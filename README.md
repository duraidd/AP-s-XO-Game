Here's an explanation of the overall flow and a list of dependencies in the above code:

**Overall Flow**:
The code initializes a socket connection to a server at http://localhost:9999.
The component renders a Tic-Tac-Toe game board, with each cell representing a possible move.
When a user clicks on a cell, the makeMove function is called, which updates the game state and emits a "makeMove" event to the server.
The server processes the move and updates the game state, then emits a "moveMade" event back to the client.
The client receives the "moveMade" event and updates the game state accordingly.
The component re-renders with the updated game state.
The calculateWinner function is called to determine if there is a winner or a draw.
If there is a winner or a draw, the component displays a message indicating the outcome.
The user can reset the game by clicking the "Reset Game" button, which emits a "resetGame" event to the server.
The server resets the game state and emits a "gameReset" event back to the client.
The client receives the "gameReset" event and resets the game state accordingly.

**Dependencies**:
React: The code uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) and React components (e.g., div, p, button).
Socket.IO: The code uses Socket.IO to establish a real-time connection to the server.
io: The code imports the io function from Socket.IO to create a socket connection.
JavaScript: The code uses JavaScript syntax and built-in functions (e.g., Array, includes, forEach).
CSS: The code uses CSS classes (e.g., app-container, board, cell, winner) to style the game board.

**Internal Dependencies**:
game state: The component's state is updated by the makeMove function, which depends on the current game state.
calculateWinner: The calculateWinner function depends on the game state to determine if there is a winner or a draw.
socket events: The component depends on socket events (e.g., "moveMade", "gameReset") to update the game state.

**Overall Flow:**
The code sets up an Express.js server and creates a Socket.IO instance to handle real-time communication.
When a client connects to the server, the connection event is emitted, and a new socket is created.
The server listens for three types of events from the client:
makeMove: When a client makes a move, the server broadcasts the move to all connected clients using io.emit("moveMade", data).
resetGame: When a client resets the game, the server broadcasts the new game state to all connected clients using io.emit("gameReset", newGame).
disconnect: When a client disconnects, the server logs a message indicating that the user has disconnected.
The server also sets up an HTTP endpoint at / that returns a simple "Tic Tac Toe Game Server" message.
The server starts listening on port 9999 and logs a message indicating that the server is running.

**Dependencies:**
Express.js: The code uses Express.js to create an HTTP server and handle requests.
Socket.IO: The code uses Socket.IO to handle real-time communication between the client and server.
morgan: The code uses the Morgan middleware to log HTTP requests in a human-readable format.
cors: The code uses the CORS middleware to enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for the Socket.IO connection.
http: The code uses the built-in http module to create an HTTP server.
JavaScript: The code uses JavaScript syntax and built-in functions (e.g., console.log, arrow functions).

**Internal Dependencies:**
io: The Socket.IO instance is used to handle real-time communication between the client and server.
app: The Express.js app is used to handle HTTP requests and create an HTTP server.
server: The HTTP server is used to listen for incoming requests and connections.
